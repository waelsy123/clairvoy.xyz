# Clairvoy.xyz Improvement Proposals (EIPs)

This directory hosts new approved improvements to the project. Each improvement should be documented in its own markdown file beginning with the prefix `EIP-` followed by a short title.

To propose an EIP, open an issue or pull request with your draft file in this folder. Once reviewed and accepted, it will remain here as part of the project's historical record.
